            <p class="u-align-center u-custom-font u-text u-text-2"> In Somnium, dreams weren't mere figments; they were Somnia, shimmering wisps of experiences woven into a tangible currency. The wealthy elite bartered with elaborate escapades, their nights filled with triumphs and conquests. Elias, a gaunt youth with eyes like embers, watched from the shadows, his pockets perpetually empty of Somnia. He peddled fragmented nightmares, bitter memories of a life spent scrounging for
scraps.
One night, a grotesque dreamscape unfolded before him. Unlike a passive observer, Elias was a puppeteer, twisting the idyllic landscape into a macabre symphony. A lavish banquet became a scene of rotting food and skeletal servants, the wealthy patrons reduced to grotesque parodies of themselves. He woke with a chilling glee, a taste for power lingering on his tongue.
Peoples' dreams were their reality in this world. He realized it he could control others' dreams. But he
...
didn't want to bet everything on his assumptions. He began invading the dreams of others. He could shape the dream with blossomy goodness or treacherous ba​​dness.
He experimented again, focusing on the recurring dream of Lord Veris, a pompous merchant who'd once driven&nbsp;Elias' family into ruin.</p>

            <h1 class="u-align-center u-custom-font u-text u-text-default u-title u-text-1">THE NIGHTMARE WEAVER</h1>
            <p class="u-align-center u-custom-font u-text u-text-2"> Elias replaced a triumphant trade deal with a scene of economic collapse; Veris was reduced to begging on the very streets he'd once exploited. <br>Word of these manipulations reached the Night Weavers, a clandestine cabal who revelled in manipulating dreams for their own gain. They saw potential in Elias, a raw talent with a burning desire for justice. Morwen, the guild master, a gaunt woman with eyes that flickered like malevolent flames, tested his abilities. 'Dreams are a fragile web,' she rasped, a cruel smile twisting her lips. 'Shatter them, and you unravel the very fabric of Somnium, plunging it into eternal night.' <br>Elias scoffed. He yearned for a revolution, a chance to topple the power structure that had kept him down for so long. <br>Under the Night Weavers' protection, Elias honed his skills. He targeted the nightmares of the wealthy, replacing dreams of financial security with visions of crippling debt. Politicians who ignored the plight of the poor were haunted by visions of an uprising. With each successful nightmare, Elias' anger towards the elite grew. He remembered the disdainful glances as he begged for scraps, the indifference of those who could afford to indulge in elaborate Somnia.

            <p class="u-align-center u-custom-font u-text u-text-2"> The city began to shift. Investors, plagued by nightmares, pulled out of deals, causing the stock market to plummet. Fear and paranoia replaced the once ostentatious displays of wealth. But even as the elite suffered, a new discontent brewed among the newly-empowered poor. They had never known the luxury of Somnia, yet Elias' manipulations brought them dreams of unimaginable wealth and power. They built extravagant mansions, their dreams manifesting as opulent reality. <br>Elias, initially filled with a sense of satisfaction, felt a growing unease. These once downtrodden people were morphing into a new kind of elite, just as greedy and callous as the old. He watched a former street urchin, a young woman he once helped, refuse aid to a starving beggar, a mirror image of the injustices he'd witnessed before. A chilling realization dawned on him the cycle of power continued even with the players reversed. <br>This marked a turning point. As he remained poor, Elias was rejected by his own people who had now become rich due to him but they did not know it was him, the cause for all their fortune. He became a whispered legend, a rebel who'd dared to challenge the system. Yet, a deep bitterness festered within him. He saw the world as a place inherently corrupt, populated by people who did not deserve the luxury of dreams.

            <p class="u-align-center u-custom-font u-text u-text-2"> Disillusioned and enraged, Elias sought Morwen. 'It doesn't matter who holds the power,' he snarled, the embers in his eyes burning with a new intensity. The rich exploit the poor, and the poor, given the chance, become just as vile. There's only one solution to level the playing field, wipe the slate clean.' <br>Morwen, intrigued by his defiance, listened in silence. <br>Elias retreated into a self-imposed exile, a state of suspended animation within the Night Weavers' hidden chamber. Here, cocooned in a vat of pulsating Somnia, he delved into the very essence of dreams. Five months flew by in a blur of dreamscapes, a symphony of desires, fears and memories. He saw the world laid bare, its inhabitants driven by primal urges for power, pleasure and survival. His anger simmered, fuelled by the cacophony of dreams. <br>He witnessed the opulent fantasies of the new elite, the same callous disregard for the less fortunate that he once despised in the old guard. He saw the simmering resentment of the forgotten, the ones who lacked the power to truly dream. The cycle perpetuated, a maddening dance of power and exploitation. <br>Finally, a horrifying clarity emerged. Humanity, in all its forms, was inherently flawed. Dreams, once a currency for escapism, became a twisted reflection of their inherent&nbsp; depravity.

            <p class="u-align-center u-custom-font u-text u-text-2"> This realization solidified Elias' resolve. He wouldn't prop up one side or the other; he would unleash a nightmare upon them all. It was a decision born not of malice, but a twisted sense of justice, a desire to purge the world of the very dreams that fuelled its corruption. <br>Morwen, ever the pragmatist, saw an opportunity in Elias' newfound resolve. As long as she wasn't subjected to the same fate, she was willing to let him unleash his power. She led him to the anchor, the heart of Somnium, a swirling vortex of dream wisps. Elias, empowered by his newfound understanding, stood before it. <br>He reached out, and the anchor pulsed in response. Images of the world flooded his mind, every city, every village, every corner echoing with the dreams of its inhabitants. With a single, chilling thought, he unleashed a wave of pure nightmare. It wasn't a targeted attack; it was a universal inundation. Visions of fear, decay and despair flooded every dream. The once vibrant dreamscapes of the newly-minted elite morphed into scenes of economic collapse, their opulent mansions crumbling around them. The aspirations of the forgotten became twisted parodies, desires for power replaced by crushing dread and hopelessness. <br>The world convulsed. People woke screaming, the vibrant city of Somnium plunged into an unending night terror. Elias, perched on a platform overlooking the city, felt a dark satisfaction.

            <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-text u-text-2"> He had become the Nightmare Weaver, the arbiter of a world stripped bare of its illusions. The screams that echoed through the streets weren't of fear, but of a dawning realization. <br>Elias, the once ostracized boy, now stood at the apex. He was a chilling testament to the society that had created him, a product of the very injustices he aimed to erase. The world, shrouded in an omnipresent nightmare, served as a constant reminder of the darkness it harboured. Perhaps, in the wake of this collective nightmare, a new society could be built, one not fuelled by the twisted desires exposed in their dreams, but by the shared memory of a terrifying lesson - a lesson woven by the Nightmare Weaver himself. The world would rebuild, but the chilling echo of Elias' despairing vision would linger forever, a constant reminder of the price of unchecked ambition and the fragility of human dreams.
